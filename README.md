# Some-Computer-Programming-Samples
These are some computer programming samples in portfolio,you can find some comments in the code header(a README.txt) or within the code at the start explaining what my code does and how it works. Also, there might be some directions on how to compile (if necessary) and execute my code.
It's my pleasure to show you some of my programming projects If you get any questions and suggestions welcome to email me@xueyun.ys@gmail.com at any time :)
